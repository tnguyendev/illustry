# Demo Day Project

A social media site for artists to showcase their artwork. Users are able to create, view, like, and comment on posts! Featured pages include a feed, explore, marketplace, and profile. Users are able to browse the feed for posts that they make, as well as posts from people they follow. The explore page allows users to receive a randomized set 10 posts everytime they refresh the page, to find new pieces and artists! In the marketplace, users are able to post their commission information, and buyers are able to checkout after choosing an artist they like. Users are able to view their profile for all the posts they've made, as well as viewing other people's profiles for other posts they've made.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

## Thoughts:

Definitely a passion project. It's something I've been wanting for a while, and something I'm incredibly proud of to work on. I hope to keep working on this project and fleshing it out more, so that one day it will be a useable site with all the features I'm looking for implemented in.
